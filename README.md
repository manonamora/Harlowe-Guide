# (Soon to be) 100% Good Harlowe-Guide
Welcome to the Git Repo for the WIP **100% Good Twine Harlowe Guide**.
This is currently a work in progress, and will be updated bit by bit. Mainly because I'ven't used a bunch of the macros yet, so I need to get on that lol

The goal is to have a similarly-styled Guide for Harlowe, as I did for the SugarCube version (see other Repo, TBL), as an alternative to the Harlowe documentation, with (maybe???) further explanations, interactive examples on the page, and organised by difficulty.
Maybe it will help future Harlowe users too?

The Guide will cover the 3.3.9 version of Harlowe. As of now, 4.0.0 is in beta with an unknown release date. 
Depending on time available, update might be done? but for now assume it will be Harlowe 3 only.

## *What to expect from the Guide?* (aka what I hope to do?)
The guide (crossed fingers) covers the full [Harlowe documentation](https://twine2.neocities.org/), as well as addition in examples, and usage of macros. Maybe also accessibility of customisation?

The guide is separated into four categories, representing different difficulties of coding:
* The Basics
    * or the absolute basics to start with Harlowe
    * *No need for extra knowledge. Just the base needed to make something.*
* ???
    * We will see when we get there.
    * I'd like to touch on the 'custom' macro API (which is kinda forbidden work lol)
<!--* The Basics+
    * adding interactivity, and creating a fully rounded IF game
    * *May require a bit of CSS knowledge (formatting rules)*
* Intermediate Mode
    * adding more customisation and complex code
    * *Will probably require some CSS knowledge, and maybe some JavaScript*
* Advanced Use
    * the most complex macros and APIs
    * *Will surely require some JavaScript/jQuery knowledge*
> Note: The Advanced Use includes all the APIs, macros, and methods not covered by the previous categories. This *will* include code requiring very advance knowledge of JavaScript/jQuery to be used properly.-->

## *How to read the Guide?*
Eventually, a "playable version of the guide will be uploaded on itch.io, as well as a downloadable version (HTML/source file). But for now, it will be here only.

Right now, I'll probably just do a 'Book' view with a category/chapter/page separation/links, to make information more digestible. Maybe I'll include a 'One-Page' view down the line? It's not a priority rn.

The guide will include multiple indexes: Chapter/Pages, Macros, and whatever else there is left.
